              unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction of
              Customer Personal Data. Neokred Technologies Private Limited
              designs its systems to only allow authorized persons to access
              data they are authorized to access based on principles of “least
              privileged” and “need to know”, and to prevent others who should
              not have access from obtaining access. Neokred Technologies
              Private Limited requires the use of unique user IDs, strong
              passwords, two factor authentication and carefully monitored
              access lists to minimize the potential for unauthorized account
              use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on:
              the authorized personnel{`'`}s job responsibilities; job duty
              requirements necessary to perform authorized tasks; a need to know
              basis; and must be in accordance with Neokred Technologies Private
              Limited{`'`}s internal data access policies and training. Approvals
              are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all
              changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for
              accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication
              (e.g., login to workstations), password policies follow industry
              standard practices. These standards include password complexity,
              password expiry, password lockout, restrictions on password reuse
              and re-prompt for password after a period of inactivity.
